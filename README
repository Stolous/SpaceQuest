This is the SpaceQuest RPG repository

How to edit using eclipse:

1. Clone this repo on the local machine
2. Create a clean workspace if you want to be tidy
3. Go to File > Import > General > Import Existing Projects into Workspace
4. Make sure "Copy projects into Workspace" is DESELECTED
5. Make sure "Select root directory" is selected and click "Browse"
6. Navigate to the repo and select it (this is the folder directly above 'SpaceQuest' and 'SpaceQuestMapEditor')
7. Click ok, it should appear in your project explorer

----------------------------------------
MAY NEED TO DO THIS:
IF YOU GET TONS OF ERRORS AND THE RES FOLDERS, LIB FOLDERS, ETC. APPEAR AS PACKAGES THEN DO THE FOLLOWING:
1. Go into your project properties
2. Go to 'Java Build Path' > 'Order and Export'
3. Check 'JRE System Library'
4. Click OK

Your folders should all be properly organized now but if your still getting errors its probably because LWJGL is no longer referenced, to fix this just re-reference the LWJGL libraries like you normally would.
----------------------------------------
